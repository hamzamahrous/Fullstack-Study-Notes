When dealing with namespaces you should write the **fully qualified name** or you can use the **using** keyword and then simplify the name.

When dealing with namespaces you should add each namespace in a sperate file.

Note that even if you have separated them using different files in the end all of them will be stored in just one assembly `.dll` and you can do a sperate assembly and add your classes so now you can use this in different projects ... you can achieve that by making a new project in VS of the type **Class Library** .. now if you want to use it you will go to the dependencies file and click right click then **add project reference**.
