An **abstract class** is a class that **cannot be instantiated** directly and is meant to be a **base** for other classes.

It can contain:
- Abstract methods (no body, must be overridden).
- Normal methods (with implementation).
- Fields, properties, constructors.

```Csharp
public abstract class Animal{
    // Abstract method 
    public abstract void Speak();

    // Normal method
    public void Sleep(){
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is sleeping...");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal{
    // Must override Speak()
    public override void Speak(){
        Console.WriteLine("Dog says: Woof!");
    }
}
```
***
An **Interface** in C# is a contract.

Key points:
1. **No implementation** (in older C# versions).  
    All methods were abstract by default.
2. **From C# 8+**, interfaces _can_ have default implementations, but typically you still use them as contracts.
3. A **class can implement multiple interfaces** (multiple inheritance).
4. Interfaces have **no fields** .. only: methods, properties, events and indexers.

```Csharp
public interface IAnimal{
    void Speak();
}

public class Dog : IAnimal{
    public void Speak(){
        Console.WriteLine("Dog says: Woof!");
    }
}
```

You can see the polymorphism applied when using interfaces .. as when you use an interface like `IShape`, and you have classes such as `Circle` and `Rect` implementing it, you can create objects of those classes but **treat them as the interface type**.

```CS
IShape shape1 = new Circle();
IShape shape2 = new Rect();

shape1.Draw();
shape2.Draw();
```

You can make the interface implement many other interfaces.

When you make your class implement many interfaces using `: INum1, INum2` for example you can when implement it use the fully qualified name to prevent conflicts between interfaces and it's **called explicit interface** .. but note that **explicit interface methods can NOT have access modifiers (will be private)**.

| Feature                  | Interface        | Abstract Class         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Can be instantiated?     | No               | No                     |
| Contains implementation? | No (except C#8+) | Yes                    |
| Fields?                  | No               | Yes                    |
| Constructors?            | No               | Yes                    |
| Multiple inheritance?    | Yes              | No                     |
| Purpose                  | Contract         | Shared base + contract |
