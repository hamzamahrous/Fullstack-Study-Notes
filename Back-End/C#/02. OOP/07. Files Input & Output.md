To deal with the files in C# first we should use the namespace `System.IO` .. then we can use **StreamReader** class or the **File (Static Class)** class.

```CS
// One of the StreamReader constructors take the file path
StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("path");

string line;
while((line = sr.ReadLine()) != null) {
	Console.WriteLine(line);
} // Print all lines to the console


string[] lines = File.ReadAllLines("path") // Same Result
```

The difference between the two methods is that `File` will upload all the lines into the memory so if the file is big you should use the `StreamReader` so now we will only add to the memory line by line which is much better for the performance.

```CS
string path = "path.txt";
StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(path); // Same as StreamReader but used to write.

writer.WriteLine("New Line");
writer.Close(); // You must close so your updates is saved.
```

Also you can use `File.WriteAllText()` or you can use the append methods to append instead of replacing the content.

`File.Exists(path)` -> Returns boolean.
