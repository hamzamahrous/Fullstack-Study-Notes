Static types in C# refer to anything declared with the keyword **`static`**. 

The idea is simple:
- **A static member belongs to the class itself, not to an object of the class.**  
- You don’t need to create an object to use it.

```CS
// If something is static, you access it like this
Person.SayHello();
```

 **Why use static?**

- Useful for helper/utility functions  
- Shared data between all objects  
- Configuration, constants, logging, global state  
- Avoid unnecessary object creation

## Types of static member

### 1- Static Fields

One shared variable for all objects.

```CS
class Counter{
    public static int Count = 0;
} // All objects see the same value.
```

### 2- Static Methods

Methods you can call without creating an object.

```CS
class MathUtils{
    public static int Square(int x){
        return x * x;
    }
}

int result = MathUtils.Square(5);
```

### 3- Static Constructor

Runs **once only**, before the run of the default constructors or before the run of any static method.

### 4- Static Classes

A class that:
- Cannot be instantiated.
- Cannot be inherited.
- Can contain only static members.

```CS
static class Utils{
    public static void Print(string message){
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}
```
