The difference between the **Fields** & **Properties** is that property is a smart field, because when you declare a property it's a normal field but it will be **private** `_name (should start with _) to follow best practices` and then you all add a getter & setter to control the logic before returning them or assigning them a value.

There's two types of constructors **default & parametrized** and it's like **methods overloading** as you can add a lot of constructors each one of them with different parameters .. note that the default constructor will be made for you even if you didn't declare it.

If you didn't add access modifier the **default is private**.
Another type of the access modifiers is the **internal** which allow access from your **assembly** (`.dll`) only.

```CSharp
public class Person {
	// Fields (public)
	public string Education;
	
	// Properties (private)
    private string _name;
    private int _age;

    // The constructor has no return type
    public Person(string name, int age) {
        name = name;
        age = age;
    } 

    // Properties (C# getter/setter pattern)
    public string Name {
	    // You can add your logic before getting or setting
        get { return _name; }
        set { _name = value; }
        
        
        get; set; // -> This's auto property and you can use it
        // when you won't add logic in get & set so it's like a 
        // shorthand for the getters & setters.
    }

    // Method
    public void Introduce() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hi");
    }
}
```
